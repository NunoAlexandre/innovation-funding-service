# Native Docker Setup 

For a more optimal experience (without consuming all of your computer's RAM), install the native Docker application.

The various OS flavours can be found from:

- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) - Requires HyperV (only with Windows Professional and above)

This has not been tested on Windows/MacOS so your mileage may vary considerably (at current).

You could run this setup from within your own custom VM setup (maybe something like CoreOS). 

## Setting Up

1. Make sure you don't have any processes running on your host machine that may have conflicting ports with the 
application stack. For example, MySQL runs on port `3306`, so make sure that you run `sudo service mysql stop` 
beforehand. 

    If you would prefer to setup your own port configuration to avoid conflicts ahead of time, please refer to the 
**'Preventing port conflicts'** section below.

2. Run the `setup.sh` script:

        ./setup.sh
        
3. Run `hosts-helper.sh` script (or manually setup your `hosts` file for Windows):
        
        ./hosts-helper.sh
        
### Preventing port conflicts

Manually configuring your ports beforehand has the advantage of preventing port conflicts with existing processes that 
may already be running on your localhost for other projects e.g. MySQL (consider running such services in a VM to 
prevent pollution of your localhost ports where possible).

During the setup prescribed above, an `.env` file is created when running `setup.sh` (using `.env-defaults`) if it does 
not already exist. This contains all the ports that will be used within the Docker setup (they are variable substituted 
into the `docker-compose.yml`).

To setup your own ports, simply provide a modified `.env` file before running the `setup.sh` in step 2 of the setup.
        
## Usage

Standard Docker + Compose usage applies from this point onwards. If in doubt, some utility scripts have been provided 
for ease of consumption:

- `start.sh` starts up all your containers. This should typically be done when you want to start working on the project. 

- `stop.sh` stops all the containers. This should typically be done when your stop working on the project or 
before shutting down. Bear in mind that the entire environment is relatively resource intensive (even at idle) and it 
is advisable not to have them running all the time (eating your RAM).

- `setup.sh` builds the entire environment using Docker and Docker Compose. Then creates the required databases in the 
 `mysql` container, runs the Flyway migrations, syncs the `shib` and `mysql` user databases and finally runs the 
  Gradle deployment tasks via `deploy.sh` (see below).
    
- `hosts-helper.sh` appends the IP forwards to your `/etc/hosts` if you run a *nix system. If you run Windows, you will 
have to manually append the IPs to your `hosts` file which will be in `C:/Windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts` (after 
changing permissions for the file). 

- `deploy.sh` is the main deployment script to build the entire application within the Docker environment. It 
essentially just runs a `./gradlew cleanDeploy` on a sub-project and then copies over the build into the required 
Docker container.
    
    Usage as follows:

        ./deploy.sh {all|data|web|asm|comp-mgt|app|ps|psm} {gradleOpts}
        
    Note: `gradleOpts` is not required. If you do specify some options they will be passed to the sub-project's 
    `cleanDeploy` task run.
    
- `frontend.sh` runs various Gulp tasks across all the projects (this might be better located somewhere else).
    
- `syncShib.sh` syncs the `shib` container users into the `mysql` container database (`ifs-database`).

- `teardown.sh` removes the existing Docker containers for the project. Don't run this unless you want to purposefully
want to destroy your environment e.g. in the event of a rebuild.

## Troubleshooting

 - In the event of catastrophic failure of your Docker containers, rebuild the entire environment by running 
 `teardown.sh` and then `startup.sh`.
