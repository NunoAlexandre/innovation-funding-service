Currently, the biggest limitation preventing it from achieving much higher uptake is stress formed during manufacture requiring support/anchor structures to hold the parts down during processing. These ‘anchors’ make it unfeasible to build numerous component geometries as anchors can be difficult, costly or impossible to remove; stresses also cause part warpage. This project will build on IP developed at Manchester University to eliminate stresses by exploiting a novel process called ‘Rovel Additive Manufacturing Process’ (RAMP). RAMP locally melts the powder feedstock as is standard in current SLM but, in RAMP, the powder comprises 2 (or more) different materials that are components of a eutectic alloy system. Thus, the melted material remains molten while surrounded by powder bed material and thus the part remains stress free i.e. the process involves manufacturing a ‘3D-puddle’ that later solidifies. The principle of manufacturing a 3D-puddle in Additive Manufacturing is well established as this is how polymer laser sintering works using supercooling polymers whose solidification temperatures are below their melting temperatures. RAMP has been demonstrated on low melting point alloys where the applicants have successfully made SLM components without any anchors/supports whereas conventional SLM would require such features. This is a ’world first’ and represents a commercially significant step change in technical capability. In the proposed project, the applicants aim to extend this to higher melting point materials to exploit a huge range of new commercial applications. The applicants have commissioned an RAMP market study by world leading market analyst Terry Wohlers who produces the Additive Manufacturing Industry’s Annual Global State of the Industry Report. The RAMP market study involved interviews with expert users of SLM technology from 14 different organisations ranging from global OEMs to SMEs spanning three different continents and highlights a number of commercial opportunities across a range of sectors for RAMP (see appendix A1 for examples).',1,2,1,1),(4,NULL,'\0','2015-09-07 14:25:30','asdfasdf',1,NULL,12,1),(5,NULL,'','2015-09-07 13:39:11','The aim of the proposed project is to establish a novel Manufacturing platform technology that is a substantial advance on the current state-of-the-art. Rovel Additive Manufacturing Process (RAMP) is a novel approach that will overcome the practical limitations of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) associated with stresses generated during the laser treatment of metallic powders to produce near-net shape components. SLM offers many benefits compared to conventional forming techniques as it is material efficient and has over the last 20 years created its own market sector. However, even though there is the potential for huge growth, SLM is still a niche area in the global marketplace. This is attributed, in part, to a conservative approach by potential industrial users and to certain limitations within the technology associated with both the process and the materials used. We propose to greatly extend the capabilities of SLM by developing equipment/processing capability with materials that are specifically suited to the technique. By so doing, we will establish a technological advance, based on the UK’s already high global profile, opening opportunities in a range of industrial sectors. The work will be based on the leading edge capabilities at Manchester University (RAMP), Empire (materials) and Ludlow (equipment) and input from companies that supply parts to end-users who will steer the research to meet performance requirements. Prime objective will be to develop the RAMP process to enable it to produce components in a range of engineering/medical materials free from stress-induced deformation and to achieve this at higher bed temperatures than are currently possible',1,NULL,15,1),(6,NULL,'','2015-09-07 13:39:11','The proposed project aligns with the scope of the Technology-Inspired Collaborative Research and Development Competition as it aims to establish a new RAMP enabling technology that will take existing laser melting additive manufacturing to higher levels of capability and performance by achieving the production of stress-free and, therefore, support/anchor free components from a wider range of materials than is currently possible. The attainment of this aim will allow the UK to establish a cutting-edge capability that will not only establish a world lead in equipment development but will allow its manufacturing sector to take advantage of global market opportunities for new products in market sectors as diverse as medical devices and transportation. It will also provide the platform for the process to be further developed to allow high melting point materials to be processed. The project will be based on state-of-the-art technology that will result in a novel development within the SLM field and will allow inefficient metal fabrication processes to be replaced by resource-efficient techniques with the capability to produce high quality parts in small or high quantities according to customer demand. Overall, the proposed project aims to develop a novel advanced production technology for the manufacture of high added value products. Thus, the main objectives of the project are consistent with the remit for the High Value Manufacturing area within the Competition.',1,NULL,16,1),(7,'2015-09-07 14:23:43','','2015-09-07 14:23:49','SLM equipment sales to component suppliers and in-house manufacturers are valued at about £20-30M pa globally and the value of parts made approximately £100M pa; annual growth is >20% pa on average since 1990 (ref: Wohlers Annual State of the Industry Report) see details in Appendix A2. There is a vast range of alloy systems that are suited to the RAMP process.  Market opportunities from RAMP will arise through a number of technology-based factors including the ability to manufacture hitherto impossible geometries, the ability to ‘stack’ parts in a bed and thus increase machine throughput and the elimination of labour intensive, costly and quality diminishing anchor/support removal. The Wohlers market analysis has established that eliminating anchors from SLM would immediately allow an increase of parts made by 60-70% based on requests for parts to be made by SLM that are currently rejected as the need for supports/anchors renders the job impossible or impractical. However, there are market opportunities beyond this - the US market for partial dentures is estimated at some $15m pa but only if supports/anchors can be eliminated from the SLM process. RAMP would significantly reduce the level of operator skill required to manufacture metal components compared with today’s SLM, the applicants believe this could open the door for RAMP to compete directly with CNC and casting technology which would open significantly larger markets.',1,2,2,1),(8,NULL,'','2015-09-07 14:23:49','Exploitable outputs will include: 1) A new, IP protected, manufacturing process with hitherto impossible capability 2) Products manufactured with hitherto impossible geometries 3) New product applications across many sectors. The applicants will protect Foreground IP and will exploit it directly within their own businesses and by licensing. Dissemination will be by industrial sales and marketing and non-confidential scientific papers. Commercialisation will begin within 6 months of project conclusion when machines will become available. Individual partner exploitation areas are: > Ludlow will gain an understanding of what commercial ALSM machines will require to satisfy an estimated a minimum market for machine sales of £67M by 2019. > Empire will, directly and indirectly, establish new markets for powder materials specifically tailored to the new process. > EGGS and AA Dental will be able to supply novel, high added value products to their customers. EGGS has identified a number of conformal cooling parts to be manufactured from aluminium-magnesium alloys. Currently, these cannot be manufactured economically by SLM as the cost of support removal is prohibitive (see example part in Appendix A3). AA Dental has identified dental prostheses as their ‘killer’ product to be made by RAMP using a cobalt/chromium alloy which they have patented. Currently, dental prostheses cannot be manufactured by SLM as the supports required cannot be removed without damaging the part (see image in Appendix A4). However, other dental products such as crowns and bridges are also anticipated to be suited to RAMP where SLM is currently prohibitive due to the need for supports. Manchester University will benefit from increased value to its background IP and the opportunity to extend its research capability. > Manchester University intends to license RAMP technology to an organisation that can satisfy the global demand for the technology as identified in the Wohlers market analysis.',1,NULL,3,1),(9,NULL,'','2015-09-07 14:23:49','What economic, social and environmental benefits are the project expected to deliver to those inside and outside of the consortium and over what timescale? The UK ‘punches above its weight’ in Additive Manufacturing, especially in SLM; it has strong industrial and scientific bases and is ideally placed to transmit developments internationally. It is therefore well placed to develop the sector and the supply chain of companies that feed into it and also the innovative SMEs that can exploit such technological advances by the design of new products. This will give significant economic impacts to the UK but also provide the associated social benefits of increased employment. The technology has clear environmental benefits in terms of the efficient usage of raw materials, the recyclability of unused powder and the creation of lightweight products. As an example from the IUK funded ATKINS project, replacing a conventionally manufactured Virgin monitor arm component weighing 0.86 Kg on an aircraft with a design optimised ALSM part weighing 0.34 Kg would reduce the lifetime CO2 emissions of a single passenger aircraft by 28.7 tonnes. Further examples of the societal and environmental benefits of RAMP from the Wohlers Market report are discussed in Appendix A5. The preceding market overview indicates that these impacts can realistically be projected to be realised within 5 years of project completion.',1,NULL,4,1),(10,'2015-09-07 10:20:41','','2015-09-07 14:27:22','What technical approach will be adopted and how will the project be managed? Our approach is to combine different feedstock materials that form a lower melting point alloy (e.g. hypo/hyper eutectic) to create an ‘anchorless SLM process window’ between the freezing temperature of the formed alloy and the lowest melting point of the feedstock material. RAMP has succeeded for low melting point (bismuth alloy) materials built on existing SLM machines with a bed temperature up to 250 deg C. To extend the process to higher melt point (engineering) materials, a purpose built system will be created with bed temperature up to 600 deg C. Appendix B1 shows the project Gantt chart and details of each work package are elaborated below. WP1 - Empire and Manchester to establish alloys with the maximum process window and examine microstructure/solubility etc. Empire to provide powder in desired, RAMP specific, alloys as WP1 progresses. Specific alloys already identified by the applicants and the rationale for their selection are described along with powder requirements such as particle size distribution in Appendix B2. WP2 - Ludlow to make purpose built RAMP machine for mid-temperature range alloys (e.g. Al and Mg). This machine will have build bed capacity of 125x125x125mm and be capable of holding a temperature of 600 deg C +/- 5 deg C. The machine will be built to appropriate safety standards such that it can be transferred to and used by trained staff at Manchester University. WP3 - the machine made in WP2 will be used to run RAMP trials on Al and Mg alloys developed in WP1 and supplied by Empire. Initially simple parts will be built including cantilevers and horizontal tensile test bars of increasing overhang to establish the range of parameters over which stress-free parts can be made. Parts will be assessed in terms of surface roughness, feature resolution and mechanical properties while the ability to recycle unmelted powder from previous builds will also be investigated. Test geometries including at least one conformal cooling part will be compared with current SLM capability by EGGS. Some parts will be selected for display purposes and these will be subject to specialised surface finishing/polishing. WP4 – Based on results from WP3, Ludlow will set requirements for commercial RAMP machines to process mid-range materials such as Al and Mg alloys. The requirements for such machines will be driven by a market analysis to be conducted by Ludlow. WP5 - Manchester to run RAMP trials on CoCr alloys developed in WP1 and supplied by Empire and AA. This work will be highly risky as the machine developed in WP2 will not be capable of achieving a temperature close to the melting point of CoCr alloys. However, it is possible that the formation of an alloy, albeit below its melting point, may still allow stress reduction that allows the manufacture of small parts such as partial dentures without any anchors/supports. Initially, small cantilevers will be made and parts will be assessed for roughness, resolution and hardness while the potential to recycle unmelted powder from previous builds will also be investigated. Parts made will be compared with current SLM capability by AA. WP6 - Ludlow to set design requirements for commercial RAMP machines to process high range materials. Based on results from WP5, Ludlow will set requirements for commercial RAMP machines to process high range CoCr materials specifically for dental applications. The requirements for such machines will be driven by a market analysis to be conducted by Ludlow in the dental market that Ludlow already supplies with a range of solutions. WP7 – Empire to manage the project as described in Appendix B3 Project Milestones are presented on the Gantt Chart in Appendix B1. Deliverables are:  D1 – Specific alloys identified in the desired temperature range; compositions of powders in the charge mixture established; initial batches of atomised powders produced (by month 6) D2 – Working prototype, mid temp range RAMP machine built and commissioned (by month 12) D3 – Components manufactured on the mid temperature RAMP test bed that demonstrate elimination of internal stresses compared to benchmark parts produced on conventional commercial SLM machine (by month 21) D4 – Design requirements for manufacturing commercial mid temp. RAMP machines (by month 24) D5 – Comparative internal stress data for Co-Cr components manufactured by RAMP and conventional SLM (by month 30) D6 – Design requirements for high temperature range RAMP machines (by month 30) The consortium’s capability to undertake this work is presented in Q8 and Appendix C and an overview of resources required in Q9. Empire will manage the project using systems its staff have established over many years of co-ordinating IUK and EC funded programmes.',1,1,5,1),(11,NULL,'','2015-09-07 14:27:22','The project is based on Manchester’s novel IP that, for the first time, allows SLM to be conducted without any need for anchors/supports. A search of the literature has established that the advances proposed in this project on which RAMP are based are not available via any commercially available process. In addition, the development and supply of tailored materials by Empire and a dedicated high temperature rig by Ludlow will involve further, critical degrees of innovation that will help to build a portfolio of IP to enhance commercial exploitation. NB. RAMP does not simply reduce stresses by working at higher temperatures; it involves a novel step based on manufacturing engineering and material science that completely eliminates stresses.',1,NULL,6,1),(12,'2015-09-07 13:44:11','','2015-09-07 14:27:22','To date RAMP has only been proved to work for low melt temperature metals as machines with high enough bed temperatures do not exist to achieve the required process window for higher melt temperature materials. We will ramp up by progressing in WP3 to ‘mid-range’ temperature materials (e.g. alloys of Zinc (low risk), Aluminium (medium risk), Magnesium (medium risk)) and then in WP5 to high temperature materials (e.g. alloys of Cobalt and Chromium (high risk)). Broadly, the commercial risk is mitigated by the fact that the technology is suited to a wide range of sectors so barriers to market in any given sector would not affect opportunities in another sector. The technical risks will be mitigated by selecting a top quality multi-disciplinary team of leading players in manufacturing and materials technologies, combined with an experienced management capability, that has the resources and capabilities of achieving the project objectives. Appendix B4 provides further details regarding the management of risk including commercial risks such as cost barriers to market.',1,1,7,1),(13,NULL,'','2015-09-07 14:27:22','The consortium comprises leading companies in equipment, materials, and component development and manufacture that have participated in numerous R&D programmes in their respective fields.
