*** Test Cases ***
Competitions admin should be able to see the list of applications
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2135: listing of applications for an open competition
    [Tags]    HappyPath
    Given the user clicks the button/link    link=All applications
    Then the user should see the text in the page    Application list

The correct columns show for the application list table
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2135: listing of applications for an open competition, INFUND-3063
    [Tags]    HappyPath
    Then the user should see the text in the page    Application number
    And the user should see the text in the page    Project title
    And the user should see the text in the page    Lead name
    And the user should see the text in the page    Lead
    And the user should see the text in the page    Status
    And the user should see the text in the page    Percentage complete

The correct number of applications shows in the table header
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2135: listing of applications for an open competition
    [Tags]    HappyPath
    Then the table header matches correctly

The applications can be sorted by application number
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2135: listing of applications for an open competition
    [Tags]    HappyPath
    When the application list is sorted by    Application number
    Then the applications should be sorted by column    1

The applications can be sorted by project title
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2135: listing of applications for an open competition
    [Tags]
    When the application list is sorted by    Project title
    Then the applications should be sorted by column    2

The applications can be sorted by project lead
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2300: listing of applications for an open competition
    [Tags]
    When the application list is sorted by    Lead
    Then the applications should be sorted by column    4

The applications can be sorted by lead applicant
    [Documentation]    INFUND-3006
    [Tags]
    When the application list is sorted by    Lead Name
    Then the applications should be sorted by column    3

The applications can be sorted by percentage complete
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2300: listing of applications for an open competition
    [Tags]
    When the application list is sorted by    Percentage complete
    Then the applications should be sorted in reverse order by column    6

Calculations of the open applications
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2259
    [Tags]
    The calculation of the open applications should be correct

Calculations of the submitted application
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2259
    [Tags]
    The calculation for the submited applications should be correct

Calculations for the Number of applications
    [Documentation]    INFUND-2259
    [Tags]    HappyPath
    Then the calculations should be correct    jQuery=td:contains("00000")    css=.info-area p:nth-child(2) span
    And both calculations in the page should show the same
