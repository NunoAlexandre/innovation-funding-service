			<h2 class="heading-medium">6. What is innovative about your project?</h2>

			<p>The project is based on Manchesterâ€™s novel IP that, for the first time, allows SLM to be conducted without any need for anchors/supports. A search of the literature has established that the advances proposed in this project on which RAMP are based are not available via any commercially available process. In addition, the development and supply of tailored materials by Empire and a dedicated high temperature rig by Ludlow will involve further, critical degrees of innovation that will help to build a portfolio of IP to enhance commercial exploitation. NB. RAMP does not simply reduce stresses by working at higher temperatures; it involves a novel step based on manufacturing engineering and material science that completely eliminates stresses.</p>
