    <h2>Policy Principles</h2>
    <p>Instead of creating a number of prescriptive policies with detailed rules applicable to each area of Innovate UK, this Policy is principle based, using a three-stage
        'engagement journey' for all areas of work. Information obtained from an Information Provider (you) is separated into four 'use categories' to simply explain our responsibilities
        and treatment of that information.</p>

    <h2>Joint-Sponsors</h2>
    <p>It is noted that any Information (including Closed Information) received for a competition and/or grant (or other similar contract) run by, with or on behalf of a
        Joint-Sponsor shall be deemed to be directly shared by you with both Innovate UK and such Joint-Sponsor at the time of submission of such Information. Any Information
        generated by either Innovate UK or the Joint-Sponsor during the collaboration shall also be shared with each other on the same basis.</p>
    <p>Innovate UK and the Joint-Sponsor shall be directly and individually accountable to you for the Information it holds and shall handle such Information in
        accordance with its own funding and information management policies.</p>

    <h2>Engagement Journey</h2>
    <p>There are three stages of any engagement by Innovate UK with an Information Provider ("<strong>you</strong>", "<strong>your</strong>"), in ascending order of commitment:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Dialogue
            <ul>This concerns communication of information not under Stages 2 or 3 below; generally this is open or informal engagement without pre-defined rules or contracts.
                <li>For example, an ad hoc telephone call (not covered under a more formal relationship below).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Engagement
            <ul>This concerns communication of information under 'implied' terms in relation to which Innovate UK has specified how it will treat information.
                <li>For example, a grant application, where there is no signed contract in place, but pursuant to which we receive significant amounts of your Information.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Contractual
            <ul>This concerns any communication of information under a signed set of terms and conditions.
                <li>For example, Information received under a grant funding agreement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Journey</strong> - You can skip stages on your engagement journey, stop at any stage, and run multiple journeys simultaneously via different work programmes
        with different 'packages' of information.
    </p>
    <p>Where you move along the stages of your engagement journey, Information that you provide to us will, unless stated otherwise, be held in accordance with the terms and
        conditions of the highest level you reach with us along that particular journey.</p>
    <p>For example, if you sign a grant funding agreement with us, Information that you provided as part of the grant application process will also be held and used in accordance with the terms of the agreed grant.</p>

    <p>There are four Use Categories for the different types of Information Innovate UK receives during each stage of an Engagement Journey:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Closed</li>
        <li>Closed, with Agreed Exceptions</li>
        <li>Limited</li>
        <li>Open (Public)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The use and disclosure of Information within each use category is set out below:</p>
