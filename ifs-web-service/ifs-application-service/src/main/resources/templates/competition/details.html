            <h2 class="heading-large">Background</h2>
            <p>Innovate UK aims to stimulate business innovation across four key technology areas: advanced materials; biosciences; electronics, sensors and photonics; and ICT.</p>
            <p>The four areas are what we call ‘enabling technologies' because they underpin the development of high-value products and services that meet market needs in many industrial sectors. Advances in these areas will keep UK industry at the forefront of technological innovation and help to generate significant growth. As our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enabling-technologies-strategy-2012-to-2015">Enabling technologies strategy 2012–15</a> makes clear, supporting these technology areas is a  key aim of Innovate UK.</p>
