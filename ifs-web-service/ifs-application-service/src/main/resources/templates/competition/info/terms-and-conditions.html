    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Payment of grant</span><br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Innovate UK will pay your grant by instalments quarterly and in arrears on submission of a claim, unless otherwise agreed in your grant offer letter. This will be against your net eligible costs incurred and paid over the duration of the project.</li>
            <li>Your claims must be supported by the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>a revised forecast of eligible project costs which details expected costs for each future claim period and highlights any variations from the last forecast</li>
                    <li>an Independent Accountant’s Report (see paragraph 6)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Claims must be for completed quarters only, except for the final quarter where you may submit a claim for costs incurred but not necessarily paid, provided that the cost is:
                <ol>
                    <li>for labour, overhead and/or travel and subsistence only</li>
                    <li>paid within 30 days of the end of the project</li>

                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Innovate UK does not have to pay any claim received more than 30 days after the end of the quarter to which it relates. We will not pay any claims received later than 3 months after completion of the project.</li>
            <li>Innovate UK reserves the right not to consider new applications from organisations who have failed to return required financial reports on any projects funded by Innovate UK.</li>
            <li>Innovate UK will not pay more than 85% of the grant until all outstanding claims and supporting information have been received and the final Independent Accountant’s Report has been approved.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining detailed records and documentation relating to your award. These should provide evidence that your eligible project costs comply with all state aid rules, as outlined in paragraph 8. These records must be kept for 10 years following the award and must be supplied to the Commission within 20 days if requested.</li>
            <li>Innovate UK may appoint an auditor to ensure you are complying with the terms and conditions. You agree to give the auditor access to your project records within 2 weeks of notice of their appointment.  If the auditor determines that you should repay the grant to Innovate UK, Innovate UK may recover the cost of the auditor’s work from you.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>Innovate UK may suspend, withdraw or reclaim the grant in whole or in part. We will only do this after consultation with you, in a way that minimises the impact on your ability to deliver the project.</li>
            <li>Innovate UK may suspend grant payments, by serving you with written notice specifying the breach and requiring it to be remedied within 30 days in the event of the following:

                    <li>you become insolvent, are declared bankrupt,  placed into receivership, administration or liquidation, or a petition has been presented for its winding up, or any similar arrangements that may affect you financially (including any requirements imposed by GBER (see paragraph 8))</li>
                    <li>there is a change to your legal status</li>
                    <li>you have breached state aid rules as set out in paragraph 8</li>
                </ol>

    <li class="list-bold"><span>Financial reporting</span>
        <ol>
            <li>You agree to appoint an Independent Accountant who will inspect your financial statements relating to the grant. They will prepare an Independent Accountant’s Report using Innovate UK’s standard template, at the intervals stated in the relevant guidance note. The Report will contain an opinion that:
                <ol>
                    <li>the financial information and level of grant claimed are accurate and legitimate</li>
                    <li>eligible costs that you have submitted have been properly incurred and paid</li>
                    <li>you have provided satisfactory explanations for any queries raised by the Independent Accountant</li>
