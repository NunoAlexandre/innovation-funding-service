    </div>

    <ol class="list-alpha">
      <li>These terms and conditions (“the Terms and Conditions”) apply to organisations (“Partners”) applying for grant funding either individually or in undertaking collaborative projects with other applicants. The Partner must accept the Terms and Conditions before the Grant funding award (“the Award”) may be confirmed. Formal submission of an application in respect of a competition confirms full acceptance of these terms by the Partner.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of Project set up process, the Partner will receive an Award Letter confirming the Award which will include any Project-specific additional conditions of Award, and/or variations to these standard Terms and Conditions. The Award Letter confirming the Award must be countersigned by the Partner, and uploaded in the correct manner, to ensure it is activated.</li>
    </ol>

<ol class="list-counted">
    <li class="list-bold"><span>General Terms and Conditions</span>
        <ol>
          <li>Innovate UK reserves the right to vary the Terms and Conditions of this award unilaterally and at any time by giving the Partner three (3) months’ notice of any such variation before it is due to take effect.</li>
          <li>The Partner may not assign, transfer, sub-contract, or in any other way make over to any third party any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement.</li>
          <li>Failure to exercise, or any delay in exercising, any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.</li>
          <li>This Agreement shall not create any partnership or joint venture, nor any relationship of principal and agent, between the parties, nor authorise any party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the other party.</li>
          <li>This Agreement is made solely for the benefit of the parties to it and it is not intended to benefit or be enforceable by any other person.</li>
          <li>Innovate UK :
              <ol>
                <li>accepts no liability for any consequences, whether direct or indirect, that may come about from the Partner undertaking the Project, its use of the Grant, or termination of the Award; and</li>
                <li>limits its liability under this Agreement to the payment of outstanding Grant available.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>A Partner’s liability under this Agreement is limited to repayment of the Grant which it has received under this Agreement.</li>
          <li>This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England.</li>
          <li>No Grant funded activity should be used to further party political considerations, or for party political purposes, or for lobbying for political parties, nor should personal political views influence project activity in relation to the Award. Should this term be breached it may lead to the suspension, withdrawal and/or clawback of any Grant already paid by Innovate UK, in accordance with paragraph 7.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Term</span>
        <ol>
          <li>The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Project start date confirmed by Innovate UK in the Award Letter (“the Project Start Date”).</li>
          <li>The Agreement shall remain in force until the Project end date declared in the Award Letter, or the date upon which the Project is terminated or is otherwise completed, whichever is sooner (“Project Completion”).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Partner’s Obligations</span><br/>
        It is a condition of the Agreement that the Partner shall comply with the following:

The Partner shall also inform Innovate UK in writing as soon as it becomes aware that any of the events referred to in paragraph 7 has taken place;</li>
          <li>the Partner must ensure that Grant claims are submitted promptly as required by paragraph 5;</li>
          <li>failure to comply with any one of the conditions in this paragraph 3 will result in claims <strong>not</strong> being processed and/or paid.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Project Monitoring</span><br/>
        <ol>
          <li>Innovate UK shall monitor the progress of the Project in accordance with Innovate UK’s project monitoring guidelines as updated from time to time (“<strong>Project Monitoring Framework</strong>”), unless Innovate UK agrees, in its sole and absolute discretion, to waive or vary this requirement.</li>
          <li>The Project shall be assigned a Monitoring Officer (“MO”) who will be the primary point of contact for the Project over its lifetime, and will monitor the Project throughout and report progress to Innovate UK on a periodic basis.</li>
          <li>If during the Project the Partner is or becomes aware of any impediment relevant to the progress, outcomes or exploitation of the Project, the Partner shall promptly inform Innovate UK, via the MO.</li>
          <li>Monitoring of the project will comprise Review Meetings between the Project and the MO to review the Project’s progress, and may include a Project visit.  Dates for reviews should be agreed directly with the MO.</li>
          <li>Within three (3) months of Project Completion, the Partner shall provide the MO with the Project Final Report, for onward submission to Innovate UK.</li>
          <li>At Project Completion, the Partner will also be required to supply the MO with the following:
              <ol>
                <li>confirmation that the final claim has been submitted; and</li>
                <li>confirmation that an Accountant’s Report has been submitted, certifying all eligible Project costs incurred and defrayed (notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5.5.1) between the most recent date upon which an Accountant’s Report was submitted and Project Completion.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Payment of Grant</span><br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Grant will be payable against the net eligible costs incurred and paid on or after the Project Start Date and on or before Project Completion declared by the Partner in its acceptance of the Award Letter. The Grant will be payable by instalments on submission by the Partner of a claim and the supporting information set out in paragraph 5.4.</li>
            <li>Grant will not be paid against ineligible costs.</li>
            <li>Unless Innovate UK otherwise agrees, claims for costs incurred and paid must be submitted promptly on a quarterly basis commencing from the Project Start Date.</li>
            <li>Claims must be supported by the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>a current forecast of <strong>eligible</strong> Project costs to the end of the Project, detailing its expected costs for each future claim period, highlighting any significant variations from the last forecast;
                        <ol>
                            <li>All award holders should be aware that Innovate UK operates an <strong>annual cap policy</strong> by which any underspend exceeding £5,000, relative to the projects financial forecast at the beginning of the financial year, will be retained at Innovate UK’s financial year end (31 March of any given calendar year). For the avoidance of doubt this money will not be available subsequently to the project;</li>
                            <li>requests for adjustments to forecasts will not be accept in quarter 4 of Innovate UK’s financial year (01 January to 31 March of any given calendar year) and variations, where accepted, may take up to three (3) months to be reflected in the system.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>an Accountant’s Report, prepared in the manner described in paragraph 8, submitted by the Partner at those intervals stated on the relevant guidance note, which Innovate UK will supply upon request.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>When making claims pursuant to paragraph 5.1, the following applies:
                <ol>
                  <li>claims must be for eligible costs incurred and paid for wholly completed quarters only  (the Partner is not allowed to submit more than one claim to Innovate UK relating to any particular calendar quarter), except for the final Quarter where the Partner may submit a claim for costs <strong>incurred</strong> but not necessarily defrayed prior to Project Completion, provided that:
                      <ol>
                        <li>the payment is for eligible labour, administration support and/or travel and subsistence costs <strong>only</strong>;</li>
                        <li>the payment is defrayed within <strong>30 days</strong> of Project Completion; and</li>
                        <li>the payment is included within the final Accountant’s Report;</li>
                      </ol>
                      failure to comply with this paragraph will result in Innovate UK reclaiming Grant against all such costs incurred.
                  </li>
                  <li>once a claim and the supporting documentation set out in paragraph 5.4 has been received by Innovate UK , the corresponding Grant will normally be paid within 30 days, unless it is necessary for Innovate UK to seek further information to support the claim;</li>
                  <li>where Innovate UK  needs to seek further information to support or understand the claim, Innovate UK  agrees to contact the Partner within 14 days of the claim being received.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Innovate UK  shall be under no obligation to pay any claim received by Innovate UK  more than <strong>30 days</strong> after the Quarter during which the eligible cost(s) specified in the claim was incurred and paid by the Partner;</li>
            <li>Innovate UK  shall be under no obligation to make any payment on claims received later than three (3) months after completion of the Project, and there will be a general presumption that claims received after this date will not be paid;</li>
            <li>Innovate UK reserves the right not to consider new applications from organisations who have failed to return required financial reports on any projects funded by Innovate UK.</li>
            <li>Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 5, Innovate UK is under no obligation to pay more than 85% of the Grant awarded to the Partner until all outstanding claims and supporting information, as detailed in paragraphs 5.4, have been received and the final Accountant’s Report has been approved, such approval not being unreasonably withheld or delayed. Failure to supply an Accountant’s Report may be considered a breach of the Agreement, in accordance with paragraph 7.4.</li>
            <li>The Partner is responsible for maintaining detailed records with the information and supporting documentation necessary to establish that all the conditions set out in this Award Letter comply with all applicable state aid rules, as outlined in paragraph 10. Such records shall be maintained for 10 years following the granting of the aid and shall be made available to the Commission within a period of 20 working days if requested.</li>
            <li>Innovate UK reserves the right to appoint an auditor to ensure compliance with the Terms and Conditions (“the Auditor”) and the Partner agrees to permit the Auditor access within two (2) weeks of notice of their appointment.  In the event that the Auditor determines that the Partner should repay the Grant to Innovate UK, Innovate UK reserves the right to recover the cost of the Auditor’s work on this project.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Changes to the project</span>
        <ol>
          <li>In the event that during the period of the Project, any material change occurs, or is likely to occur, to:
            <ol>
              <li>the expected delivery timescales or outcomes for any work package or the Project as a whole; or</li>
              <li>the Project’s costs, budget, or allocation of costs between budget line headings; or</li>
              <li>the ability of the Partner to deliver the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and the Exploitation Plan;</li>
            </ol>
            then the Partner must inform Innovate UK through the assigned MO promptly and work with Innovate UK to ensure a mutually acceptable beneficial arrangement can be agreed.
          </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Suspension, withdrawal and repayment of Grant</span>
        <ol>
            <li>There may be occasions when Innovate UK is required to suspend, withdraw or reclaim the Grant in whole or in part. In doing so Innovate UK shall at all times act reasonably and in consultation with the Partner.  Innovate UK will use reasonable efforts to minimise the impact of any such actions on the ability of the Partner to deliver the Project’s outcomes as set out in the Project proposal and Exploitation Plan.  In such circumstances, Innovate UK will notify the Partner and, where reasonable, work with it to resolve any underlying issues before taking such action.</li>
            <li>In particular, but not exclusively, Innovate UK may <strong>immediately</strong> suspend Grant payments to the Partner in the event of any of the following:
                <ol>
                  <li>the failure of the Project to provide any of the information required in paragraph 5;</li>
                  <li>the reasonable suspicion of fraud involving the Partner;</li>
                  <li>failure to maintain satisfactory progress on the Project;</li>
                  <li>any material changes to the proposed outcomes of the Project;</li>
                  <li>the project is insufficiently resourced or managed to achieve delivery;</li>
                  <li>the material failure of the Partner to use reasonable efforts to progress the Project or perform the work it agreed to perform under the Project Plan and/or Exploitation Plan submitted to Innovate UK; or</li>
                  <li>the Partner do not comply with, or observe, any other condition of this Agreement;</li>
                </ol>
                such Grant remaining suspended until the breach has been rectified by the Partner, to the satisfaction of Innovate UK, within a maximum of 14 days of that breach having been notified, or within an alternative time scale, as determined by Innovate UK in its sole and absolute discretion, and considered reasonable in the circumstances for such corrective action(s) to be commenced and/or completed.
            </li>
            <li>In particular, but not exclusively, Innovate UK may <strong>withdraw</strong> future Grant payments to the Partner in the event of any of the following:
                <ol>
                  <li>the Partner fails to remedy a breach in the time scales permitted by paragraph 7.2, or such a breach is not reasonably remediable;</li>
                  <li>any error in the Project proposal which significantly changes the expected benefits accruing from the Project or its exploitation, and corrective action cannot reasonably be taken by the Partner;</li>
                  <li>a Partner becomes insolvent, or is declared bankrupt, or is placed into receivership, administration or liquidation, or a petition has been presented for its winding up, or it enters into any arrangement or composition for the benefit of its creditors, or it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, or the Partner does or suffers anything substantially equivalent to any of the foregoing;</li>
                  <li>there is any change in the legal status or the actual or effective ownership or control of the Partner;</li>
                  <li>there is a breach of the state aid rules as set out in paragraph 10.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>In particular, but not exclusively, Innovate UK may require <strong>repayment</strong> of Grant already paid from the Partner in the event of any of the following:
                <ol>
                  <li>an overpayment of Grant has occurred, whether disclosed by a report or otherwise and as soon as demanded by Innovate UK,  or upon the Partner becoming aware of such overpayment, whichever occurs first;</li>
                  <li>it is found that a Partner, knowingly or unknowingly, has provided false information associated with, or in support of, its application for Grant funding;</li>
                  <li>fraud, or claiming Grant against ineligible costs or costs not actually incurred and paid;</li>
                  <li>a material element of the Grant being used for purposes unconnected with the Project;</li>
                  <li>the Partner has breached state aid rules as set out in paragraph 10.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Reporting</span>
        <ol>
            <li>The Partner agrees to its financial statements relating specifically to the Grant being inspected by an independent accountant (“the Independent Accountant”) who shall prepare a report of his/her findings (“the <strong>Accountant’s Report</strong>”), at those intervals stated in the relevant guidance note, using Innovate UK’s standard template, such a report containing an opinion that:
                <ol>
                  <li>the financial information and level of Grant claimed are both accurate and legitimate;</li>
                  <li>eligible costs in respect of which the Partner has submitted claims have been properly incurred and paid; and</li>
                  <li>satisfactory explanations have been provided by the Partner for any queries raised by the Independent Accountant.</li>
               </ol>
               The Independent Accountant must be appointed by a Partner in a manner consistent with Innovate UK’s Standard Terms of Engagement of Accountants, as may be amended from time to time to accord with national accounting standards and professional best practice. All costs must be supported by an Accountant’s Report, and any uncertified costs will be ineligible for Grant.
            </li>
            <li>If requested by Innovate UK, the Partner’s latest published annual accounts or management accounts. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph shall require the Partner to provide financial information in breach of any law, order or regulation restricting such disclosure; and</li>
            <li>In exceptional circumstances, Innovate UK may also require an Accountant’s Report to be submitted before the final claim. Such exceptional circumstances shall include without limitation:
                <ol>
                  <li>withdrawal from the Project;</li>
                  <li>termination of the Project;</li>
                  <li>a claim disclosing expenditure substantially greater than forecast; or</li>
                  <li>a suspicion of a breach of this Agreement.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Confidentiality and Information Management</span>
        <ol>
          <li>Innovate UK reserves the right to request from the Partner access to any additional information deemed necessary by Innovate UK in connection with this Award.  The Partner must provide or allow access to such requested information within two (2) weeks of such a request.</li>
          <li>Innovate UK shall retain the Partner’s Personal Data and Confidential Information in confidence and only use such information as detailed in Innovate UK Information Management Policy, as published on its website.  Information shall only be disclosed by Innovate UK in accordance with the Information Management Policy, as set out in Innovate UK’s corporate terms and conditions, and paragraph 13.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>State Aid Obligations</span>
        <ol>
          <li>The Partner shall not act in any way to undermine Innovate UK ability to comply with the terms of its Research, Development and Innovation Scheme (TSB2/2014) operating under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (“the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)”).</li>
          <li>The Partner must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this offer. It is the responsibility of the Partner to ensure that its cumulative total of public funding does not exceed those limits stated in TSB2/2014 and GBER.</li>
          <li>No payments shall be made to the Partner if it becomes subject to a recovery order following a previous Commission decision declaring any aid illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</li>
          <li>The Partner confirms that they are not a company in difficulty as defined in Article 2.18 of GBER and commits to informing Innovate UK as soon as reasonably practicable of a change in this status. Innovate UK reserves the right to terminate the agreement if the Partner’s status changes.</li>
          <li>Further to paragraphs 7 and 10.1, Innovate UK may vary or withhold any or all of the payments and/or require <strong>repayment</strong> of Grant already paid, <strong>together with interest from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate</strong>, if Innovate UK is required to do so as a result of a decision by the European Commission arising from a breach of State aid regulations.</li>
          <li>No subcontract may be made which would constitute a breach of state aid obligations.</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Intellectual Property</span>
        <ol>
          <li>For the avoidance of doubt, Innovate UK has no interest in the ownership of any intellectual property rights (“IPRs”) or other rights developed under or arising as a result of the Project, or in the terms of any IPR licences executed by the Partner, beyond ensuring that the results and exploitation of the Project detailed in the Project proposal and Exploitation Plan are capable of being achieved. Innovate UK also has no financial interest in or claim over any financial benefits arising directly or indirectly from the Project beyond the right to withdraw or reclaim the Grant as set out in Paragraph 7.1.</li>
          <li>Throughout the period of the Project the Partner shall make commercially reasonable enquiries concerning pre-existing third party IPRs that may adversely affect the achievement of the intended Project objectives and/or outcomes and shall use its best endeavours to ensure that there are no impediments to the effective carrying out of the Project and/or the exploitation of the Project's results.  In the event of a successful claim being made against the Partner for a breach of IPRs relating to the Project, Innovate UK reserves the right to reclaim Grant paid.</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Exploitation of Project Results</span>
        <ol>
          <li>The Partner is expected to promptly refine and update the Exploitation Plan, which is a key deliverable of the Project, to reflect the results as the Project progresses.</li>
          <li>During the period starting on the date on which the final payment of Grant is made and ending five (5) years thereafter (the “Exploitation Period”) the Partner shall take reasonable steps to exploit the results of the Project as set out in the Project proposal and/or Exploitation Plan, or by other means acceptable to the Partner and Innovate UK.  Innovate UK is prepared to consider alternative means of exploitation where this brings increased economic growth or improved quality of life to the UK or wider European Economic Area (“EEA”) equivalent to that offered by the Project proposal.</li>
          <li>On Project Completion, and for a period of up to 5 years thereafter, Innovate UK may wish to evaluate the impact of funding awarded to the Project. The  Partner is expected to comply with all reasonable requests for information made for this purpose.</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>UK Statutory Framework</span>
        <ol>
          <li>Innovate UK is subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”). Where any request is made to Innovate UK under FOIA for the release of information relating to the Project, and such information would reasonably be considered as confidential, Innovate UK  shall notify the Partner of the request as soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it. Innovate UK shall not disclose any information belonging to a Partner without first considering and discussing with the authorised signatory of the Partner whether sections 41 and/or 43 of the FOIA are applicable.</li>
          <li>Innovate UK agrees to comply and have adequate measures in place to comply fully and at all times with the provisions and obligations contained in the Data Protection Act 1998, as amended from time to time.</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="list-bold"><span>Publication of Information</span>
        <ol>
          <li>Innovate UK publicises the results of competitions and applications. This includes posting material on its website, making references to projects at events, social media activity, references in presentation material, and engagement with the media. In accepting the Award, the Partner agrees to Innovate UK making publicly available on its website the Project Title, the public description of the Project already provided for publicity purposes, and the corporate identity of Partner associated with the Project.</li>
          <li>The Partner is actively encouraged to seek their own publicity.
