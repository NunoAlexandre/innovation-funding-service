    <h3 class="heading-medium">Creating an account</h3>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>You must create an online account to apply for funding.</li>
      <li>When you create an account you will be able to apply to competitions; track your applications; view application feedback and, if successful, set up your project online.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="heading-medium">Lead organisation</h3>
    <p>You are the lead organisation if:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>you are responsible for collecting the information for the application.</li>
      <li>inviting other contributors and/or collaborators</li>
      <li>you will lead the project if your application is successful</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="heading-medium">Contributors and collaborators</h3>
    <p>
      When you start your application you will be asked to invite contributors and collaborators.
      Contributors are people in your organisation that you can invite to help you complete your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaborators are partner organisations that you may want to work with on the project.
      If you are working with partner organisations you will need to invite collaborators as representatives of your partners to complete the application.
      Collaborators enter their own project costs and contributions into the application.
      As the lead organisation you will be able to see a summary of your partnersâ€™ costs but will not see the detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partner organisations may be other businesses, research organisations, a public sector organisation or charity.
   </p>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">Business eligibility</h3>
  <p>
    To claim public funding for your project, your business must be registered in the UK when the project starts. You must also work on the project in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
    For further information please see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovate-uk-funding-general-guidance-for-applicants#funding-rules">funding rules</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-medium">Research partners</h3>
  <p>
     There are specific rules for research partners which limit the amount of involvement a research partner may have in your project. The participation rule will be set out in the eligibility criteria.
  </p>


  <h3 class="heading-medium">Project costs</h3>
  <p>
  As a business, if your application is successful you will receive a percentage of your eligible project costs. You must be able to fund the remainder of the project costs. The amount of grant funding you can claim will depend upon the size of your organisation and the type of research activity you are undertaking in the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some types of cost which are not eligible. For full details on what costs you can claim please see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/innovate-uk-completing-your-application-project-costs-guidance"> project costs guidance.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Eligible project costs are paid quarterly in arrears once you have submitted a claim for those costs with evidence showing how they were incurred.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">Your application</h3>
	<p>Before you apply you should take a look at the questions you will need to answer.</p>
	<p>You will need to take some time to prepare the answers to these questions.</p>
	<p>By creating an account you and your contributors/collaborators can log back into the service to work on your application as you collate the information.</p>
	<p>The competition has an application deadline.</p>
	<p>It is an absolute deadline and will not be extended.</p>
