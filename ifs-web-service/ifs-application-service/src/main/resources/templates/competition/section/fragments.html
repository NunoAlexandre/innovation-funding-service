                <p>Technology is transforming our lives and brings great opportunity. The UK is strong in fundamental research across many different disciplines. However, we sometimes struggle to fully commercialise the opportunities. The most promising emerging technologies and industries need to be guided through the innovation process to market success.</p>
                <p>Enabling technologies or capabilities have the potential to make a difference in many sectors. Yet, they can be slow to spread through target industries. They need support to realise that potential. Some might need to be tailored to excel in the most important markets and sectors.</p>
                <p>The governmentâ€™s Emerging Technologies and Industries strategy aims to provide investment to help companies explore the potential of completely new technologies in their particular markets. It aims to disrupt markets and bring the potential for significant commercial results. Small early investments are followed by increased financial and wider support. This can be seen in areas with very high potential, such as quantum technologies.</p>
                <p>The Enabling and Enabling Technologies programme brings together technology and end users to enhance productivity and efficiency across the UK economy. The programme provides opportunities for innovative companies to develop and use multiple technologies. Applications include disrupting markets and finding new sales routes. This could be through well-established systems integrators and manufacturers.</p>
                <p>In 2016 and 2017 the programme will support companies through investments such as this competition. We will invest in enabling technologies by concentrating on innovative applications and/or service-led solutions in the areas of cybersecurity, data, satellite earth observation, electronics, sensors, photonics, the internet of things and robotics and autonomous systems.</p>
                <p>The Emerging and Enabling Technologies sector group supports the Digital Catapult and Satellite Application and is establishing a new Compound Semiconductor Applications Catapult in Wales. Companies wishing to access the available equipment and expertise are invited to partner with the Catapults in this competition.</p>
                <p>If you want help to find a project partner, contact the Knowledge Transfer Network.</p>
