There are lots of scripts in these subdirectories. 
Currently the only scripts which are up to date are those found in the /Represtative folder. The rest are obsolete against any of the new data sets, and in many cases were not completed. They remain present to give examples of the sort of behaviours that we might want to replicate in future. Note however:
1) We would want the scripts to be parameterised as those in representantive are so that we can point them at different environments
2) We would want the timings of the scripts in keeping with what we see in reality. This will mean some searching through google analytics to get ideas about how long have been spent on different pages. This is something that has been done for the scripts in the representative folder.
